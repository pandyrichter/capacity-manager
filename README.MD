# Tank
Tank is a tool to for project managers to understand current and planned workloads.

# Framework
Tank is built on the following tools:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

For data persistence, we use a simple [Airtable](https://airtable.com/) database to manage our projects (planned and active). Tank is built to work with Airtable out-of-the-box. However, we'll provide support for additional data-structures in the future.

# Installation
`npm install`
